Implementations of the Phoneword application form the Xamarin Forms Quick Start tutorial for iOS only.

*Note* - These projects are only for iOS.

These were implemented in Xamarin Studio Community v6.0.2 on OS X.  I have not tried to build these on Windows.

Phonewordcsharp: C# implementation.

Phonewordfsharp: F# implementation.

To get started, clone this repository, then open the particular project in Xamarin Studio and make sure Xamarin Studio is restoring the packages.  If it doesn't, right-click on the Solution in the Solution Explorer and select "Restore NuGet Packages".
